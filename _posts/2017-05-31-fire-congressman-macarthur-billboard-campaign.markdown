The "**Fire Congressman MacArthur Billboard Campaign**" is a project I initiated with the goal of uniting progressive resistors from throughout our South Jersey region. It worked! This was another (very visible!) action step in our shared goal to fire Congressman MacArthur--and any other politician who puts their pocketbook ahead of their constituents, and their party above country. Our voices are strong and united! More actions will follow!
I am so pleased by our united effort, and achievement of this goal in just 10 days! Please enjoy, take and share photos to spread the word. Also look for media coverage which we anticipate within the next week or so following our press releases. The second wave of our billboard campaign will begin in Ocean County in the second week of June.
Here are the groups whose members stepped up, and made our billboard action happen! Special thanks to Lisa Cenneno, Andrea Burton Gurney, and Susan Pansius of the NJ 3rd District Action Group. We worked together to develop our caption, the layout, and our press releases. Thanks for the individual contributions and support from the following groups;, SJ Women for Progressive Change, Camden County Indivisible, Progressive Democrats of Cherry Hill, the South Jersey Action Committee, Indivisible New Jersey, SJ Democratic Women, Our Revolution, Burlington County, and Local Berniecrats NJ.
