**Another "SUCCESS" for Indivisible!**
Tom MacArthur has resigned as cochairman of the centrist Tuesday group
The decision announced Tuesday cane after MacArthur ruled house moderates and many of his south jersey constituents by cutting a deal with the hard right House Freedom Caucus for an amendment that would weaken some of the health law's protections for people with Pre-existing conditions.
